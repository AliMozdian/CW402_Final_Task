# CW402_Final_Task
The repository for the final task of Computer Workshop course in 1402
The reason behind creating this repository is that our teacher and T.A. decided to help students by not taking a final exam in the limited time of final exams in the University, and assigning this task to us for the score instead of getting that from the final exam, therefore thank you.

I learned many things in your class and more important, I heard about many different fields in your class which are really rare to hear in this stage as none of my friends in other universities had such a useful course in the their first term of studying in University.
Best regards
